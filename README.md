# EdusmartDataAnalysis
Project for Edusmart Inc to analyze trends in student data

Description:
  This project was given to me by Edusmart Inc to work with team lead to design and builda dashboard to view software usage patterns. It was created rest analytic APIs using Flask framework that are called by a javascript and CanvasJs based frontend to generate dashboard charts. The front end was written in JavaScript and HTML. I also used Microsoft SQL Server aggregation  functions to perform analytics in the backend which were eventuall displayed in the front end.
  
How to run:
  Have project anywhere in local directory. Make sure to have Python 3 installed and navigate to the directory project is located in. Type in "python app.py" to launch the main application and it will start a server running on the localhost. Open up localhost page in any browser and the dashboard will be displayed by the browser including all the graphs for analysis.
